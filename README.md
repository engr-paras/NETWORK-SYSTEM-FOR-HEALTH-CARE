# 🏥 Design and Implementation of Healthcare System Network – Cisco Packet Tracer  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the **design and implementation of a secure healthcare system network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
The network is built to connect different healthcare departments while ensuring:  
- Reliable communication  
- Optimized performance through subnetting and VLANs  
- Scalability for future IT needs  
- Security to safeguard sensitive healthcare data  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Design a network topology connecting **OPD, Emergency, Pharmacy, Labs, and Administration**.  
- Configure **routers, switches, and VLANs** for smooth communication.  
- Implement **IP addressing and subnetting** for efficient resource allocation.  
- Apply **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to limit unauthorized access.  
- Strengthen **network security fundamentals** to protect healthcare records.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Software:** Cisco Packet Tracer  
- **Concepts Applied:**  
  - TCP/IP & Subnetting  
  - VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing  
  - Static/Dynamic Routing  
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs)  
  - Basic Network Security Principles

## 🚀 Implementation Steps  
1. Designed healthcare network topology with routers, switches, and end devices.  
2. Assigned **IP addressing scheme** and performed **subnetting**.  
3. Configured **VLANs** for department-wise segmentation.  
4. Implemented **routing protocols** for inter-department communication.  
5. Applied **ACLs** to control access between departments.  
6. Verified **connectivity, performance, and access restrictions** with test cases.
